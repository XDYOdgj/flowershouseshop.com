	var commentsList = [{"user":"Lourdes L.","content":"Hello!These are great; we are running out of them and ordering a new set. They are very easy to use and strong. We use to pre-drill, but that is really not necessary. We never use the drill to drive them, only by hand, using a screwdriver.We have seen some complaints of anchors broken or deformed, and that also happened to us (deformed) when hitting a piece of wood or something else (and we checked for no stud before trying). In that cases (unexpected obstruction) we just cut the anchor and use only the portion that screws into the drywall.As soon as we notice an obstruction, we stop driving them, unscrew, cut, and drive again (by hand, slowly, not by using the drill, ever). When no obstruction, they work like a charm.If you hit something after the anchor started screwing into the wall, and you keep driving or are using a power drill, the drywall will break for sure and the anchor will deform, like in some photos, because the anchor will not drive anymore, and it is being forced against the obstruction (if by power drill, even worse).Those photos with big holes broken drywall, and striped anchors, never happened to us, as we do not use the power drill to drive them, and we stop driving as soon as we notice the anchors touching something (after the first deformed one, quick learning). They drive smoothly into the drywall if no obstruction is found (and our house is just one year old in Florida).We haven't try other brands or styles for drywall and we won't, these are the ones, no doubt on that. Some items bought brought their own similar ones, but they don't compare in quality, so not used, used these ones.For unobstructed drywall, look no further, we highly recommend CrimsonMark self-drilling drywall plastic anchors.","purchase_model":"Size: Nylon Number of Items: 50  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-18 16:00:34"},{"user":"dmtrend","content":"Very sturdy.

They are easy to use and relatively sturdy considering it is made from nylon. I use them to hang picture (with frames), pot rack, or wall mount tool rack. I think it can hold 20lb without issue, but there are other factors like how far the thing is poking out from the wall, etc.Overall I am leaning to use my stud as the main load bearing mount, use these anchors when I cannot meet the stud on one side of the frame/shelf/etc. Regardless, these anchors are worth every penny and are easy to use (drill a smaller pilot hole first) for home DIYers.","purchase_model":"Size: Nylon Number of Items: 120  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-24 16:00:34"},{"user":"MICHAEL R MYERS","content":"Bought these to make sure that the wire shelving in my closets stayed attached to the wall.The shelves had been installed 20 years ago, and several of them eventually pulled out of the wall and crashed violently to the floor.These anchors are self-drilling and are easy to drive in with a cordless screwdriver.Make sure you measure at least twice and only drill when you're sure of the spot you want to install them.I also used the included screws which makes this kit all the handier.Compared to the price of these anchors at the local hardware store, this kit more than paid for itself with the savings.Highly recommend.","purchase_model":"Size: Nylon Number of Items: 120  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-21 16:00:34"}];
