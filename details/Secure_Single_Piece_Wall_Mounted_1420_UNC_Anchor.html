The TOGGLER SNAPTOGGLE design is brilliant and makes the process quick and hassle-free.The 100-pack is an excellent value and perfect for multiple projects. They made hanging heavy items an absolute breeze and hold an incredible amount of weight.","purchase_model":"Size: 100 Pack w/ Bolts   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-25 16:00:34"},{"user":"Beth","content":"These are extremely strong and the most versatile wall anchor that I have found.They work in 3/8\" drywall, but will also work in depths of up to 3 5/8\".It also requires a slightly smaller hole than standard toggle bolts.My house has plaster wall of various thickness.Some areas used a plaster board with metal lath and plaster on top, making for very thick, uneven and brittle walls.Standard nylon drywall anchors will not work.The wall chips out too much.Toggle bolts may need to be so long to get through the drywall, that the bolt itself won't fit in the wall cavity.Of course, with standard toggle bolts, you lose the toggle the first time you take the bolt out.With snaptoggles, you drill the hole, insert the toggle, pull it tight, and then insert the bolt, so their is not an issue with bolt length that you have when you have to have the bolt in when you insert the toggle with a standard toggle.I do recommend that you buy some 1/4\" fender washers to use with these when working with materials that might not have a clean hole when you drill.That just insures that your toggle won't pull back through the hole.These things do have a downside, which I have come to terms with.Some of the toggles will break during installation.It is not a big deal.You can just use another one in the same hole. Still, it makes an already expensive anchor more expensive when you waste some.In my twenty pack, I broke 7.Part of that is because of my stupidity.The nylon zip part of this anchor does not provide any of the strength of this anchor.The strength is all on the metal toggle and the bolt.You do not need to pull that nylon zip super tight.Since I learned that, I am not breaking too many.Still, you may break some.One example of the pluses (mostly) and minuses of this product was when I tried to anchor my toilet recently.The flange bolts on one side were not holding.When I went to replace the bolt, I found that the flange opening for the bolt had widened out over time, so the flange bolts would never hold.I thought I was going to have to pull the toilet, and either replace the flange or repair it, then clean out the old wax ring, install a new one and remount the toilet.Instead, I used a snaptoggle.The first one broke, I think because the flange was not flat underneath, resulting in an awkward angle to thread the bolt in.The second snaptoggle worked like a charm.I finished in five minutes (ok maybe fifteen).Now my toilet does not wobble, and I did not have to go through the time, expense and mess of messing with the flange, wax ring and pulling and remounting a toilet.I'm fine with spending $2 or $3 in snaptoggles to get that done.","purchase_model":"Size: 10 Pack w/ Bolts   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2019-09-05 16:00:34"},{"user":"J. Carpenter","content":"Used a handful of these to hang a projector and a retractable screen. My first time mounting anything on a ceiling, and, for whatever reason, I was nervous the entire time, but it was no sweat! Luckily, these little guys are easy as pie to use, and rated for FAR more weight than they are holding. Sure, 1/2\" holes are big, but they're not huge and easily filled.","purchase_model":"Size: 10 Pack w/ Bolts   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-03-22 16:00:34"},{"user":"jw","content":"These things worked great!, After our house was painted our toilet paper holder kept getting looser and looser. I finally put in a larger plastic anchor since the hole was worn. That anchor also got looser so I replaced it with a butterfly toggle. Unfortunately the drywall behind must have degraded so the the butterfly was also loose. When I installed this I was concern that my hole was slightly larger than 1/2 need because of degraded drywall. I installed it and when I got the last turns on the screw it is incredibly sturdy. Next time I have an issue this will be my first stop for getting the anchor back into the wall.","purchase_model":"Size: 10 Pack w/ Bolts   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-03-30 16:00:34"},{"user":"doLo","content":"A friend recommended these to me so I ordered a box just to have around at the new home.Went to mount a tv above the fireplace and the studs didn't align where I could properly hide the outlets behind the TV and center it where I wanted it.Had to buy some washers and some longer bolts, but got a full articulating Amazon Basics wall mount and 65\" TV hung with the Toggler.Super sturdy and TV hasn't fallen off the wall yet LOL.","purchase_model":"Size: 100 Pack w/ Bolts   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-21 16:00:34"}];
